<p>This site is focused on gaming (video games and tabletop), camping, camping gear and the crossover of tech in camping gear.</p> 
	
	<p>Some tech you can add to your pack is extremely useful but can have a specific purpose for what you are doing. Are you going for a long trekking adventure? Car camping or taking your quad out for a few days? These are questions that you have to ask yourself before deciding what to bring with you! My  BioLite burner is great, but on long treks it becomes too heavy (figured that out the hard way) compared to lighter, fuel based burners.&nbsp;</p>
	  
	<p>In the gaming section, we will cover everything from tabletop games (Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic: The Gathering) to video games for both PCs and consoles. We will   provide reviews, mods and tutorials for the games we play.</p>
